##This is a demo app that takes a list (implemented through an included JSON file) of technologies and some info about them, and allows a user to select from the list to expand and read more in a way that's captivating to a given user.

##One of the highlights (for me), was adding some the animation when a given technology is used implementing 'LayoutAnimation' from the react-native library. The particular method is spring, and when invoked in the life cycle method, an element bounced and fades in.

##Cloning this repo and running an npm install, followed by the command "react-native run-ios" will allow for this demo to be used in the simulator.

Thank you to Stephen Grider for his Udemy course 'The Complete React Native and Redux Course' which provided the guidance for the flow of the framework.

*note: demo assumes user has some basic knowledge of react-native's simulator and has also installed this library*
